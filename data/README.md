# Dataset

We use the public [Amazon dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html) (*Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food* category, 5-core version) as our build-in datasets. Other datasets in the paper can be generated by the jupyter notebook in the data folder. Beauty.ipynb is ready to run without the original data file, while the others need to download the orignal files and assign corresponding paths in the notebook.

Our framework can also work with other datasets easily. We describe the required files below.

**train.csv**

- Format: `user_id \t item_id \t time`
- All ids **begin from 1** (0 is reserved for NaN), and the followings are the same.
- Need to be sorted in **time-ascending order** when running sequential models.

**test.csv & dev.csv**

- Format: `user_id \t item_id \t time \t neg_items`
- The last column is the list of negative items corresponding to each ground-truth item (should not include unseen item ids beyond the `item_id` column in train/dev/test sets).
- The number of negative items need to be the same for a specific set, but it can be different between dev and test sets.
- If there is no `neg_items` column, the evaluation will be performed over all the items by default.

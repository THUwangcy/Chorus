# Dataset

We use the MovieLens-1M dataset as the built-in dataset. And the Beauty dataset can be generated by `Beauty.ipynb`. 

**train.csv**

- Format: `user_id \t item_id \t time`
- All ids **begin from 1** (0 is reserved for NaN), and the followings are the same.
- Need to be sorted in **time-ascending order** when running sequential models.

**test.csv & dev.csv**

- Format: `user_id \t item_id \t time \t neg_items`
- The last column is the list of negative items corresponding to each ground-truth item (should not include unseen item ids beyond the `item_id` column in train/dev/test sets).
- The number of negative items need to be the same for a specific set, but it can be different between dev and test sets.
- If there is no `neg_items` column, the evaluation will be performed over all the items by default.
